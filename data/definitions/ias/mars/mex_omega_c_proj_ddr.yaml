  title: 'OMEGA C-channel Map-Projected Observations Data Cubes'
  description: |
    These data cubes have been specifically selected and filtered for studies of the *surface mineralogy* between
    1 and 2.5 μm.

    They contain all the OMEGA observations acquired with the C channel after filtering. Filtering processes have been
    implemented to remove some instrumental artefacts and observational conditions. Each OMEGA record is available as
    a netCDF4.nc file and an idl.sav.

    Both files contain the cubes of reflectance of the surface at a given longitude, latitude and wavelength. The
    with lambda from 0.97 to 2.55 microns (second dimension of the cube with 120 wavelengths).
    The spectra are corrected for atmospheric and aerosol contributions according to the method described in Vincendon
    et al. (Icarus, 251, 2015). It therefore corresponds to albedo for a lambertian surface. The first dimension of
    the cube refers to the length of scan. It can be 32, 64, or 128 pixels. It gives the first spatial dimension. The '
    third dimension refers to the rank of the scan. It is the second spatial dimension.
